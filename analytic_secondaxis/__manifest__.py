    Add a second analytical axis on analytic lines allowing you to make
    reporting on.

    This module allow you to make cross-reporting between those two
    axes, like all analytic lines that concern for example:
    The activity "Communication" and the project "Product 1 Integration".

    This second axis is called "activities" and you will be able to define for
    each analytical account, what are the allowed activities for it.

    There's also a kind of heritage between analytical account. Adding
    activities on parent account will allow child to benefit from. So
    you can define a set of activities for each parent analytic account
    like:

    Administratif
        - Intern
        - Project 1
    Customers project
        - Project X
        - Project Y

    What will be true for Administratif, will be true for Intern too.
