When adding price rule to a delivery carrier one can chose how price
rule will be combined. By default it's a OR combinaison, meaning it
stops after the first condition that is true and compute the price based
on this rule.

With this module one can chose AND combinaison, meaning it sums the
price for all the price rules in the deliver carrier and it cannot
compute if there is one rule that is not verified.
