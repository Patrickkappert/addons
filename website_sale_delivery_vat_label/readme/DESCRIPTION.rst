This module adds a commercial legal requirement concerning
the price of a delivery method when it includes/excludes the taxes.
It is mandatory to add a label explaining that the price is taxes included/excluded.
If, on a delivery method, multiple taxes are defined and at least one is included in Price,
the commercial legal requirement will be *incl. VAT*.
